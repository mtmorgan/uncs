  <h1>Uncs</h1>

  <p>
    'Uncs' is, apparently, a term used by the younger peoples to refer to older
    individuals with unappreciated wisdom. This project looks at our family
    ancestry.

  <h2>People</h2>
  <p>
    Some of the information available for people in this project is summarized
    in the table below. Additional data, e.g., sources, could also be extracted
    from the original Google sheets.
  </p>

  <People />

  <h2>Ancestry</h2>

  <p>
    The graph below represents relationships between people in the previous
    table. Hover over nodes to show the name and dates (if available) of
    individuals. Click on an individual for additional information on place of
    birth, siblings, and other notes. Use the scroll wheel or two fingers on a
    touch pad to zoom in. Click and hold to move the graph.
  </p>

  <p>
    Imagine moving from the central node. The maternal lineage branches 'right'
    and the paternal lineage 'left'. Counterclockwise arcs in the graph
    represent lineages where, across generations, paternal information is
    available. Beware that in the graph some lineages cross each other visually;
    be sure to follow the lineage you're interested in!
  </p>

  <p>
    From a high-level view, the graph suggests that paternal lineages are
    generally easier to follow the maternal lineages. Also, the deepest lineages
    involve generations on the same continent (the Johnson maternal lineage in
    the US; the Morgan paternal lineage in the UK).

  <h2>Implementation notes</h2>

  <p>
    Ancestry information was collated by Rachel. The original Google Sheets
    document was parsed using <em>R</em>, particularly the
    <a href="https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org">googlesheets4</a>
    and <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr</a> packages. The
    <em>R</em>
    representations were translated to JSON using
    <a href="https://jeroen.r-universe.dev/jsonlite">jsonlite</a>, with JSON
    further transformed using
    <a href="https://mtmorgan.github.io/rjsoncons">rjsoncons</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This application uses the <a href="https://svelte.dev">svelte</a>
    framework. Data are displayed using
    <a href="https://datatables.net/">DataTables</a>. The ancestry graph uses
    <a href="https://graphology.github.io/">graphology</a>
    and
    <a href="https://www.sigmajs.org/">Sigma.js</a>. I developed the ancestry
    ÃŸlayout algorithm, using vague memories from Mr. Smith's high school
    Calculus class -- something about 'SOH CAH TOA' on the Nile.
